# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
This is an analysis on trends for multiple counteies and multiple kickstarter campaigns both successfully and unsuccessfully funded.  The data shows there is a higher likelihood of exceeding your campaign goal for the US if launcehd in the United States between the months of June and August with a secondary spike in October.  Technology was additionally a very successful campaign even if their goal was much larger than the theatre or music goals.  This makes sense intuitively because a technological product requires R&D, production and shipping whereas music and theatre projects are more self contained in terms of production.  
Film and video was a very successful parent category as well, most of which reached or exceeded their campaign goals by up to 200%.  CAmpaigns with shorter windows of compaign donations fared better with lower required funding goals, wherea technoloogical kickstarter campaigns were more successful with larger windows of campaign donations.  This makes sense intuitively based on the intiial comments made about technological advancements needing more time and money to reach the masses in a consumable product or service.  The most successful film and video project was Anglicon which exceeded their campaign goal by 209% within a span of approximately one months time with a projected goal of $10000.  This provides insight on where and when is the best time to launch a project as well.  These trends follow the peaks we notice on the line graphs stating that between may and early august is the best time to provide a kickstarter campaign.
